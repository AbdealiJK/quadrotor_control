We would like to thank the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras for giving us the opportunity to work on a project and our guide Dr. B. Ravindran, for allowing us to work with him and his invaluable help throughout the project, right from the identification of our project topic, to helping mould approaches and identifying new directions to work in when a line of thought had to be abandoned.

\noindent Autonomous quad-rotor flight is a problem which is challenging because of complex dynamics and noise. In this thesis, we describe a method to control quad-rotors by applying policy search from reinforcement learning. We first set-up a simulated quad-rotor for testing purposes using gazebo and ROS. We then use the simulated model to learn basic control like hovering in place, and then moving in linear paths. Once a stable basic control is achieved the quad-rotor learns to move in various trajectories and paths. Finally, a payload is attached to the quad-rotor and we learn to move the payload in a specified trajectory.
